[lazyvim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) is great, but is way too noisy for my taste and is somehow not tailor-made for me.

that's why i took [my old nvim config](https://github.com/spearwolf/nvim-config), rebuilt it based on [lazy.nvim](https://lazy.folke.io/) and now it's the way i like it :) at least for now ;)

## Install

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:spearwolf/nvim-config-next.git $HOME/.config/nvim
```

__Post Setup__

the following npm packages should be installed globally:

```sh
$ npm i -g neovim @vtsls/language-server
```

That's all.

_Thank you and have a nice day :)_
